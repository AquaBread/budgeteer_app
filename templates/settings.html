    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <h4>1. Set your income</h4>
    <p>
        Start by entering your annual salary above and saving. The app uses this
        to estimate your monthly income and projected savings.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Configure your accounts</h4>
    <p>
        Go to <strong>Accounts</strong> in the top navigation and add at least
        one debit account (and optionally credit accounts) that you spend from.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Create your monthly budget</h4>
    <p>
        Open the <strong>Budgets</strong> page and choose a month in
        <code>YYYY-MM</code> format.
        For each category, enter how much you plan to spend that month, then
        save.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Add transactions</h4>
    <p>
        On the <strong>Transactions</strong> page, record your spending
        manually:
        pick an account, date, amount, and category. Use “Expense (−)” for
        spending and “Refund/Income (+)” when money comes back in.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Set up recurring expenses</h4>
    <p>
        Use the <strong>Recurring</strong> page for fixed monthly costs (rent,
        subscriptions, etc.).
        Add each recurring expense once, then on the Transactions page you can
        apply this month’s recurring expenses in a single click.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Read the dashboard</h4>
    <p>
        The <strong>Dashboard</strong> shows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your estimated monthly income.</li>
        <li>Total budgeted vs spent so far this month.</li>
        <li>Whether you’re ahead or behind your plan (pro-rata variance).</li>
        <li>A suggested daily cap for the rest of the month to stay on
            track.</li>
        <li>Projected savings for the current month.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Adjust as you go</h4>
    <p>
        As the month progresses, tweak your budgets, add or edit transactions,
        and watch how your remaining allowance and projected savings change.
    </p>
    <h4>8. Organize your categories</h4>
    <p>
        Use the <a href="{{ url_for('category_groups.index') }}">Category Groups</a>
        page
        to group categories (e.g., Housing, Food, Transport) so your budgets and
        charts are easier to read.
